# Date reference functions

## Purpose

Business reports are prepared once a month, once a quarter or once a year.
Analysts often compare business results against previous periods. 
First and last days of a given period are of special significance for reporting.

The `dref_` prefix stands for **d**ate **ref**erence functions. 
The functions with the `dref_` prefix return a reference date to the chosen date.

## Functions

The functions work within three types of periods:

* a month
* a quarter
* an year

The functions return one of the four types of reference dates:

* the first day
* the first working day
* the last day
* the last working day

The names of functions combine the `dref_` prefix and the first letters 
of the chosen reference date.

For example, `dref_fdoy()` returns the **f**irst **d**ay **o**f an **y**ear.

The table summarizes all date reference functions.

|                   | of month       | of quarter     | of year        |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| first day         | `dref_fdom()`  | `dref_fdoq()`  | `dref_fdoy()`  |
| first working day | `dref_fwdom()` | `dref_fwdoq()` | `dref_fwdoy()` |
| last day          | `dref_ldom()`  | `dref_ldoq()`  | `dref_ldoy()`  |
| last working day  | `dref_lwdom()` | `dref_lwdoq()` | `dref_lwdoy()` |

All functions take the argument `date`, which is the base date.
The functions return the result in reference to the base date.
The functions always work within a specific period: a month, a quarter 
or an year.

### Monthly periods

The reference dates in the image below can be retrieved 
with the following functions:

* `dref_fdom()` - dark blue
* `dref_fwdom()` - light blue
* `dref_ldom()` - light green
* `dref_lwdom()` - dark green

The base date has been marked with orange.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dref_monthly.png")
```

### Quarterly periods


The reference dates in the image below can be retrieved 
with the following functions:

* `dref_fdoq()` - dark blue
* `dref_fwdoq()` - light blue
* `dref_ldoq()` - light green
* `dref_lwdoq()` - dark green

The base date has been marked with orange.

**Watch out!** 
The first day of a year is the same as the first working day of a year. 
The last day of a year is the same as the last working day of a year.
Hence, the same day is marked with two colors (darker and lighter).

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dref_quarterly.png")
```

### Yearly periods

The reference dates in the image below can be retrieved 
with the following functions:

* `dref_fdoy()` - dark blue
* `dref_fwdoy()` - light blue
* `dref_ldoy()` - light green
* `dref_lwdoy()` - dark green

The base date has been marked with orange.

**Watch out!** 
The first day of a year is the same as the first working day of a year. 
The last day of a year is the same as the last working day of a year.
Hence, the same day is marked with two colors (darker and lighter).

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dref_yearly.png")
```
